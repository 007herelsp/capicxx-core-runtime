1) Generate CommonAPI and CommonAPI-DBus C++ files from src/helloworld.fidl
 - for now CommonAPI-DBus is mandatory, future versions of the examples won't depend on any middleware

2) Init autotools:
  $ autoreconf -i

3) Compile sources:
  # optionally override the path where CommonAPI is installed
  $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/CommonAPI:/path/to/CommonAPI-DBus:/path/to/dbus-patched
  $ ./configure
  $ make

4) Make sure dbus session bus is available:
  $ env |grep DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
  (output must not be empty!)

5) Run the stub
  $ ./helloworld-stub
  (should block and wait for calls)

6) Run the client on another console, while the stub is running:
  $ ./helloworld-proxy
  (should call the stub and exit with the response)
