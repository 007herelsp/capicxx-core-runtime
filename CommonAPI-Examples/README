=== Preliminary remarks

The examples describe how some standard problems of interface design and implementation can be solved with Franca IDL and CommonAPI. Before you start make sure that your environment is properly installed as described in the integration guide. Please do not consider only the integration guide in this document but also in the binding specific tutorial.

The examples provide a more or less generic CMake file for building the executables. Two executables are needed: a service and a client program. The standard procedure to build one of these example programs is:

----
$ cd build
$ cmake -D USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI=ON/OFF ..
$ make
----

Set USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI to ON if you use an installed version of CommonAPI; set it to OFF if you use working copy.

Here are some hints if you want to configure your eclipse project for the CMake build:

- Install the CMakeEd plug-in which provides an editor for CMake files (http://cmakeed.sourceforge.net/eclipse/).
- Create a build directory (eg /build) directly in the project directory.
- Select the projects properties, then C/C++ build and set the Build Command to your make call:
----
make -C ${ProjDirPath}/build VERBOSE=1
----

The Build Directory must be empty. Create a make target (eg via Window->Show View->Make Target). Set the build command to:

----
cmake -E chdir build/ cmake ..
----
