The current version can be taken from the git.

== Description

The term "gluecode" refers to a binary that contains the binding specific generated code from the Franca files
"test-derived-types.fidl", "test-interface-proxy.fidl" and "test-predefined-types.fidl" that are delivered in the
src directory within that project.

There are some configure options that allow you to define the binding that should be tested:

--with-gluecode-path=... specifies the path to your gluecode containing the directories src-gen and .libs.

If you want the gluecode to be linked dynamically, use --with-gluecode-so-name=... to name the *.so file. The .so file must reside
within .libs in the gluecode path.

If you want the gluecode to be linked statically, use --gluecode-a-name=... to name the *.a file. The .a file must reside
within .libs in the gluecode path. For statically linked gluecode you also have to specify your binding. To do that use either
--with-binding-so=... or --with-binding-a=..., depending on whether your binding should be linked dynamically (*.so) or 
statically (*.a) respectively. Use the full path to your binding.
If your binding needs additional libraries, use --binding-extra=... to specify them.

== Usage

1. Generate CommonAPI code for all .fidl files within /src using the code generator. After that you should find the generated files in /src-gen
2. Run autoreconf -i
3. Configure the project to find the gluecode (see also "Description")
   Examples:
   a) configure --with-gluecode-path=~/CommonAPI-D-Bus-Tools/org.genivi.commonapi.dbus.verification \
                --with-gluecode-so-name=libDBusGlue.so
      Uses dynamically linked gluecode file "libDBusGlue.so"
   b) configure --with-gluecode-path=~/CommonAPI-D-Bus-Tools/org.genivi.commonapi.dbus.verification \
                --with-gluecode-a-name=libDBusGlue.a \
                --with-binding-so=~/CommonAPI-D-Bus/.libs/libCommonAPI-DBus.so
      Uses statically linked gluecode file "libDBusGlue.a" and dynamically linked binding 
      "~/CommonAPI-D-Bus/.libs/libCommonAPI-DBus.so"
   c) configure --with-gluecode-path=~/CommonAPI-D-Bus-Tools/org.genivi.commonapi.dbus.verification \
                --with-gluecode-a-name=libDBusGlue.a \
                --with-binding-a=~/CommonAPI-D-Bus/.libs/libCommonAPI-DBus.a \
                --with-binding-extra=~/libdbus/dbus/.libs/libdbus-1.so
      Uses statically linked gluecode file "libDBusGlue.a" and staticalls linked binding "~/CommonAPI-D-Bus/.libs/libCommonAPI-DBus.a". The binding in this example needs an additional library "~/libdbus/dbus/.libs/libdbus-1.so".
      If you do not need that, you can omit the --with-binding-extra option 
4. Run make all
5. Execute ./verification in order to run the test cases
